# DeviantArtScraper

Python-powered automated data scraper and image downloader for DeviantArt.
Alpha v0.1

------------------

It can:
* Download a whole gallery of an author
* Download a whole collection or a folder
* Download all search results for a given query
* Download pretty much any bunch of images, if they can be viewed in the same feed
* Download images in highest resolution available. 
  That is, if the artist has published full-sized image (there's a "Download" button at the page), it'll be the one downloaded.
  Otherwise the scraper will download the largest thumbnail available
* Download "Mature Content" images
* Scrape data about images: description, date, resolution etc.
